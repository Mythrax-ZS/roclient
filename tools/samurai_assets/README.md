# Samurai artwork compiler

This tool imports **already generated artwork** into SPR 2.1 + ACT 2.5. It does
not paint artwork, infer feet from silhouettes, normalize individual poses,
guess hands, or synthesize missing motion. Source pixels are sampled on a fixed
grid and RGBA values, including partial transparency, are encoded as truecolor.

Run from the client repository:

```powershell
py tools/samurai_assets/compile.py C:/path/to/build.json --output C:/path/to/compiled
py -m unittest discover -s tools/samurai_assets -p 'test_*.py'
```

Python 3.12+ and Pillow are required. The output is staged in the supplied
directory. Installing files into an overlay is a separate, deliberate step.

## Input metadata

All paths in the JSON resolve relative to that JSON. `downsample` is one positive
integer divisor for **every body frame**; 4 means a 256px source cell becomes a
64px game cell. Sampling happens before trimming, so cropped bounds cannot
change the pixel phase between frames. The trimmed output is padded to even dimensions for
integer ACT center positions. `origin` is the fixed ground position in the
source cell, and is rounded to a game pixel after division. Advancing feet must
move around this origin; do not move the origin to follow the leading foot.

A sheet may specify a single positive `source_scale` (default 1) to calibrate a
generator's differently sized atlas against the master. For example, 0.95
scales the entire sheet's artwork by 95% before the common divisor. Both steps
are applied in **one** nearest-neighbor affine sample with a fixed spacing, not
two successive resizes. The same scale applies to every pose in that sheet;
all rectangles and origins remain authored in original source coordinates.
This is explicit atlas calibration, never per-pose silhouette normalization.

The following outline uses three sheets. Add every group 0 through 12 exactly
once. Column selection explicitly controls timeline order and frame repetition.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "name": "Samurai — RO revision",
  "body": "ember_ronin",
  "weapon_name": "katana",
  "downsample": 4,
  "head_anchor_y": -40,
  "mirror_directions": {"NE": "NW", "E": "W", "SE": "SW"},
  "sheets": {
    "states": {
      "path": "source/states.png",
      "cell_size": [192, 256],
      "rows": ["S", "SW", "W", "NW", "N"],
      "origin": [96, 232]
    },
    "walk": {
      "path": "source/walk.png",
      "cell_size": [192, 256],
      "rows": ["S", "SW", "W", "NW", "N"],
      "origin": [96, 232]
    }
  },
  "groups": [
    {"index": 0, "sheet": "states", "columns": [0], "interval_ms": 200, "loop": true},
    {"index": 1, "sheet": "walk", "columns": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "interval_ms": 100, "loop": true}
  ]
}
```

The example above is an outline and intentionally omits 11 groups. The standard
groups are 0 idle, 1 walk, 2 sit, 3 pickup, 4 ready, 5 attack1, 6 hurt, 7 freeze,
8 die, 9 freeze2, 10 attack2, 11 attack3, 12 cast. ACT order is always
`group * 8 + direction`, with directions S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. Mirroring
reflects the entire layer geometry, including x offset and rotation. Mirrored
costume asymmetries reverse; symmetric costumes avoid that discrepancy.

A sheet can have `offset: [left_margin, top_margin]`. For an explicitly measured
nonuniform grid, replace `cell_size` with `x_edges: [0, ...]` and
`y_edges: [0, ...]`. These are authored coordinates, never inferred gutters.

For a source cell that needs measured correction, use:

```json
"cell_overrides": {
  "walk:2:3": {"origin": [96, 232], "shift": [0, -1], "rect": [576, 512, 768, 768]}
}
```

Keys are `sheet:row:column`. `rect` uses absolute source image coordinates;
`origin` stays relative to that rectangle; `shift` uses game pixels. These are
placement metadata and do not redraw pixels. For mixed-sheet timelines, a group
may supply `frames: {"S": [{"sheet":"states","row":0,"column":3}, ...], ...}`
instead of `sheet`/`columns`, for each unmirrored direction. Each reference can
also override `rect`, `origin` and `shift`. A sheet may omit `rows` when every
group using that sheet supplies explicit frame references (for example, when
directions are columns rather than rows).

## Separate katana

Existing weapon art can be decoded from an SPR without changing its pixels:

```json
"weapon": {
  "spr": "../ember_ronin/katana.spr",
  "image": 0,
  "source_grip": [12.5, 6.0]
}
```

`source_grip` is the handle's authored grip position in that SPR image. Add
`weapon_poses` to each armed group. It maps each **unmirrored direction** to
exactly one entry per body timeline frame:

```json
"weapon_poses": {
  "S": [
    {"grip": [4, -25], "rotation": 30, "scale": [0.7, 0.7]},
    null
  ]
}
```

`grip` is measured in game pixels relative to the shared ground origin;
`rotation` is clockwise screen degrees. `null` means no weapon layer. Directions
without weapon poses are unarmed. The compiler computes layer center from the
authored grip; it never detects a hand by color. Reflection automatically mirrors
the weapon geometry alongside the body. Body and katana always get identical
104 action counts, frame counts and delays, including unarmed empty layers.

## Review outputs

`validation_report.json` checks strict SPR/ACT parsing, all image references,
104 actions, paired weapon timelines and the client atlas dimensions. It records
source/config checksums and every source cell's fixed origin and edge contacts.
It records all nonzero-alpha contacts separately from visible contacts (alpha
128 or greater), so nearly invisible generator residue is distinguishable from
likely clipped anatomy. Neither measurement modifies the source alpha.
An edge contact signals possible clipping and requires visual inspection.

The thirteen `contact_*.png` sheets show all eight directions and every frame.
`preview.html` plays all directions simultaneously with speed, stepping and
weapon controls. **Both are built from decoded output binaries**, not from
uncompiled source imagery. The exported PNGs preserve decoded RGBA values.
Preview browser/Pillow rotation sampling may differ slightly from the GPU.

Structural validation cannot prove art style, correct direction, foot alternation,
weapon grip anatomy or convincing animation. Inspect those, the end-to-start walk
transition, source clipping flags, and the live client before release.

## Format implementation provenance

`ro_formats.py` is copied from the workspace's original
`rathena/tools/custom_job_sprite/ro_formats.py`, authored for the first Samurai
package. It includes links to primary format implementations consulted by that
writer. No game artwork or stock extracted reference sprites are included in
this tooling directory. The package's generated artwork provenance belongs with
the runtime overlay and its source build metadata.
